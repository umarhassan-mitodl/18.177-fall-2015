Problem Set 1
-------------

1.  Let B{{< sub "t" >}} be standard Brownian motion and f(x) = x3+ex. Compute df(B{{< sub "t" >}}) using the formalism of Ito's formula.
2.  Work out an explicit example (as small as you like) of the Cori-Vaquelin-Schaeer, the Mullin bijection, the hamburger cheeseburger bijection, and the bipolar planar map bijection.
3.  Generate a uniform random spanning tree on a small graph (by hand) using coin tosses and Wilson's algorithm.
4.  If you have the range of a stable subordinator of parameter α and the range of another stable subordinator of parameter β, what conditions on β and α ensure the intersection of these two sets is almost surely empty? Use the Bessel process relationship to explain your answer.
5.  Read and take notes on Berestycki's [Introduction to the Gaussian Free Field and Liouville Quantum Gravity (PDF - 2.8MB)](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~bishop/classes/math638.F20/Berestycki_GFF_LQG.pdf). (You may also consult [Gaussian free fields for mathematicians](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312099) and the introduction to [Liouville quantum gravity and KPZ](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1560).) Try working through some of the exercises.
6.  Come talk to me at some point about open problems and / or your final project.

Problem Set 2
-------------

1.  Read and take notes on [Schramm-Loewner Evolution (PDF)](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~james/Lectures/sle.pdf) by Berestycki and Norris. (You may also consult the notes by Lawler, by Kager / Neinhuis, and by Werner in the {{% resource_link 1c43d624-ee12-198a-8382-22e3fa098f69 "readings section" %}}.) Try working out a few of the things left as exercises.
2.  Read and take notes on one of the references (your choice) from the Selected References on Universal Object Relationships portion in the {{% resource_link 1c43d624-ee12-198a-8382-22e3fa098f69 "readings section" %}}.
3.  Read and take notes on one of the papers (your choice) about growth models in the {{% resource_link 1c43d624-ee12-198a-8382-22e3fa098f69 "readings section" %}}.
4.  Come talk to me at some point about open problems and / or your final project.

Final Project
-------------

The final project may be either expository or original-research based. Several research problems are suggested in the {{% resource_link 49490425-2a78-e86d-7013-d8c5a84f39c4 "Open Problems (PDF)" %}} document. Collaborative efforts will be allowed. The final project is due on last day of class.
